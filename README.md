## Introduction
This analysis will review our findings from EDA of the combined beers and breweries data sets, and a KNN classification model for categorizing a beer as Ale or IPA. We used ML methods to replace missing data and statistical background to explore the findings. We analyzed the data sets on median IBU, median ABV, and beer style—by region—to determine how we could optimize this data for the company, Budweiser.

## Structure of Repository
### Data Source
* [Breweries.csv](https://github.com/generalshermanw/DDS_6306_CaseStudy1/blob/main/Data%20File/Breweries.csv): US breweries dataset
* [Beers.csv](https://github.com/generalshermanw/DDS_6306_CaseStudy1/blob/main/Data%20File/Beers.csv): US craft beers dataset

### CodeBook
* [Case Study](https://github.com/generalshermanw/DDS_6306_CaseStudy1/blob/main/CodeBook/budweiser_case_study.Rmd) - Rmakrdown file with detailed analysis
* [Case Study:Knit HTML](https://github.com/generalshermanw/DDS_6306_CaseStudy1/blob/main/CodeBook/budweiser_case_study.html) - HTML file

### Power Point

## Conclusion
There may be an opportunity for Budweiser to consider increasing their ABV - perhaps in only certain states; or possibly introducing a new product that puts a spin on the classic beverage, to meet consumer preferences in places such as Colorado and Oregon, the states with the highest ABV and IBU respectively.
